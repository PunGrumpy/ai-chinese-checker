# 🐉 Chinese Checkers Game

## 🤔 What is Chinese Checkers?

**Chinese Checkers** is a strategy board game originating from Germany, known as "**Sternhalma**". It can be played by two, three, four, or six players, either individually or in teams. The game is a modern and simplified variation of the game **Halma**.

## 🎮 How to Play

The game is played on a star-shaped board with 121 spaces. Each player has 10 pieces of a unique color, which start at one of the six points of the star and aim to reach the opposite point.

The gameplay is turn-based, where a player can move one piece to an adjacent space or jump over other pieces. A player can jump over their own pieces or their opponents' pieces and can perform multiple jumps in a single turn.

The game ends when a player successfully moves all of their pieces to the opposite point. The first player to achieve this wins the game.
